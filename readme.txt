Altitude App

Version 1 - Current Version

Altitude is an app that allows teams to group together and manage and organize their projects visually, add, modify and remove projects, in order to easily manage your past, current and upcoming projects. Assign team members to individual projects or to individual tasks inside a project. Choose from a wide variety of project templates to manage your different project tasks.

Create new projects on the app and the app will suggest ways to improve and manage your project, so that you can ultimately deploy it with success.

Version 2

The second version can feature a social platform where users who sign up for an account can see other user's projects, collaborate and discuss project design and more. Messaging and commenting on projects can also be added.

Version 3

The 3rd version can see the app evolve to employ a powerful project creator application featuring tools to fully create and manage an actual project internally in the app. The app can even deploy your project for you. 
 

Pitch: Humans are highly visual creatures. In fact 30% of our cerebral cortex is dedicated to our visual sense. This is why it is important for visual design and details in applications. Altitude is a new visual approach at a project management web platform that enables you to manage your workflow and organize your everyday projects all in one place. Say goodbye to excel project management. Altitude enables you to first create a project prototype and lets you design the prototype and develop it into a project which you can then further develop and manage. Try Altitude today for free!
